## I am interested in how things hold and leak. 

I am currently writing a book about how a building is made and is made possible within and across different kinds of practices. Variations of a Building draws on ethnographic fieldwork with architects, engineers, politicians, acousticians and in sites of public engagement. It is interested in the techniques of sharing in the act of creation, the conditions of a building project, and its political effects. 

I am also currently interested in the challenges of making noise thinglike in diverse knowledge practices, and what it means to listen to anthropogenic climate change. 

I am a part-time lecturer in the Department of Architecture at the University of Manchester. I recently completed my PhD there as well. Before that I received my undergraduate degree in Political Science and English Literature at the University of Western Ontario, and a Masters of Arts in Theory & Criticism at the University of Manchester.
